## Overview
Arcadia is a wrapper framework built atop [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) to mimick the routing and handling of the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework made for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). It is built to be a simple and easy to use framework that allows you to quickly build a web application with minimal setup, and a lot of flexibility in comparison to merely using Express.js.
